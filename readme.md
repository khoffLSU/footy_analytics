## Soccermatics
The most comprehensive education available on how to work with football data. The course covers how to understand the game using mathematics, statistics and machine learning.  It is an excellent way to combine interests as a long time player, coach, datahead and python enthusiest.  All of the analysis shown is based on the documentation at this [link](https://soccermatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### Objective
My goal is to both increase my knowledge of the game of soccer and extend my knowledge of python for data analysis and problem solving.  The instructor shows how to obtain data, analyze data, and apply advanced mathmatics to analyzing football data.  While I do not expect to get a job from the effort (as indicated in the documentation), it should prove to be interesting.

### Data Sources
Primary datasource for the course:
- [StatsBomb](https://github.com/statsbomb/statsbombpy)
- [WyScout](https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000/2)

### Major Libaries
The the requirements.txt file in the repository.  I am leveraging VScode for my IDE environment, but will primarily leverage jupyter for my exploration of the process since this is not meant to result in a production ML application.  I will highlight specific libraries as the Soccermatics course make intention mention.  While MPL Soccer is definitely going to be applied, I am not sure I will manage the deployment of a webapp through Streamlit.

- [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/)

### Project Documentation
The remainder of my thoughts and notations will be present along side my code in the Jupyter notebooks created as part of the course.  I will make an effort to come back and link the jupyter notebooks for different sections of the course in this readme so they can be easily accessed. I am sure someone will remind me if I forget (probably not :smiley:)
