    "# Exploration of High Scoring Affairs\n",
    "In soccer analytics there are many results considered.  Because coaching is also interested in patterns in the game, the hidden truths in the data, a question was posed regarding high scoring games.  Is there a pattern which these games fall into, where defense is thrown out the window and goals come in high numbers.  Soccer/Football is for all intents and purposes a low scoring game. The introduction of the 3 point win was a huge shift in teams pursuing wins and not draws.  Even so, two to three goals is a pretty common outcome for a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the exceptions?  Not the one sided exceptions.  The track meets where the last team with the ball might be the winner.  The games where goals come fast and furious, but no team has a significant advantage.  Score lines like 4-3 or 5-5 come to mind.  Games with at least six goals which are well distributed.  Is there anything to learn from these *High Scoring Affairs*?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Players and Coaches\n",
    "As a player and a coach, it is assumed that high scoring games mean more time up the pitch, more aggressive and exposed play.  The assumption is that the average player position across a number of games in this category would show players in the oppositions side of the pitch more often.  Even so, that would mean more time for the opposition in defense.  Perhaps the games are about faster possessions which go uninterupted, and teams are able to progress to shooting positions more often.  How can event data to be used to learn more about the way such games are played?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding HSAs\n",
    "Polling competitions from the StatsBomb data, the goal will be to look through the history of information for HSA which have event data, and analyze the patterns associated with HSAs.  Using the Statsbomb parser, a query of the game results for competitions will be made and high scoring low differential games will be extracted so the event data can be analyzed."
