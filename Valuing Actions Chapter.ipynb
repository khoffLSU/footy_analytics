    "# Markov Chains\n",
    "A Markov chain model assumes that the change between match states does not depend on what has happened earlier, only on the current state. If the attacking team has the ball in midfield, the probability of it going into the box is the same, irrespective of whether the team has carried out a long sequence of passes, or if the ball has just arrived from a punt. This assumption oversimplifies aspects of football tactics, but it is a reasonable starting point.  Generally the window associated with ball movement is limited to about 10sec.\n",
